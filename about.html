                <p id="text1">RUFixed is an integrated software solution
                    designed to streamline the process of logging, tracking, and
                    resolving faults reported by students. It serves as a
                    centralized platform where students can report issues
                    related to their academic or campus environment, and
                    administrators can efficiently manage and resolve these
                    issues. The system ensures that faults are addressed in a
                    timely manner, enhances communication between students and
                    support staff, and maintains transparency throughout the
                    resolution process.

                        <p>The Student Portal offers an intuitive dashboard
                            where students can easily log faults, track the
                            status of their requests, and view historical
                            records. The interface is designed for ease of use,
                            with clear instructions and prompts to guide
                            students through the reporting process efficiently.
                            On the Administrator side, the dashboard provides a
                            comprehensive control panel for managing fault
                            requests. Administrators can view incoming reports,
                            assign them to relevant personnel, and track their
                            progress. The system also includes tools for
                            filtering and prioritizing requests based on urgency
                            and type, ensuring efficient task management and
                            reporting capabilities.</p>

                        <p>Fault logging and tracking in the system allows
                            students to submit requests by filling out a form
                            with details such as the type of fault, description,
                            location, and urgency level. Optional attachments
                            like photos or documents can be added for additional
                            context. Once submitted, each fault request is
                            assigned a unique ticket number for tracking, with
                            students receiving a confirmation email containing
                            the ticket number and a link to monitor the status.
                            The system provides real-time status updates,
                            showing stages like "Received," "In Progress,"
                            "Pending Review," and "Resolved."</p>

                            ability of administrators to assign requests to the
                            appropriate support staff or departments based on
                            the nature of the issue. Requests can be prioritized
                            by urgency, ensuring that critical problems are
                            addressed promptly. The system also includes
                            integrated messaging and notification features,

                            support staff. Automated notifications keep students
                            informed of status changes, while support staff can
                            request additional information or provide updates
                            directly through the platform.</p>

                            After a fault is resolved, support staff document
                            the resolution process and the actions taken, which
                            are logged in the system for future reference. Both
                            administrators and students have access to this
                            information. Once the issue is closed, students are
                            encouraged to provide feedback on their experience,
                            helping to identify areas for improvement and
                            maintain the quality of support provided.
